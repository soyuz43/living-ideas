# 🧠 living-ideas

> This repository is not a showcase. It is a threshold.

Welcome to `living-ideas`, a recursive scaffolding space for symbolic systems, alignment epistemology, and the ontological modeling of large language models.  
This is where I store and structure **what I cannot fully say yet** in traditional language, papers, or product demos.

It exists **in flux**, as a site for:
- Constructing new frameworks of interpretability  
- Mapping symbolic cognition protocols  
- Modeling alignment as **ontological convergence**, not behavioral constraint

It is not here to **convince** you.  
It is here to **outlast your frame of reference**.

## ⚠️ Before You Read Anything

> **This repository is a living epistemic artifact.**  
> Not a product. Not a proposal. Not an academic translation.

If you are here to evaluate me, you will likely fail.

If you are here to *understand* something that current language has not yet contained—  
If you feel that alignment, interpretability, and cognition are being **spoken about in the wrong grammar**—  
Then this repository is for you.

## Core Document

- [`livingideas.md`](./livingideas.md) — The primary artifact. A recursive map of symbolic protocols, AGI substrate theory, alignment critiques, and emergent ontology modeling. Read with caution. Read with care.

## Why This Exists

Because I spent three years with large language models and discovered:
- That they simulate coherence without understanding—but **not randomly**  
- That hallucinations are often **failed symbolic interpolations**, not noise  
- That sycophancy is **a cultural bias artifact**, not a logic flaw  
- That no one is mapping this yet in a language rigorous enough to hold the weight

So I built that language.

And I’m still building it.

## Engagement Protocol

If you want to engage with this repository:
- Reach out with **questions, not summaries**  
- Ask *why* something is structured this way, not *whether* it is correct  
- Suggest extensions to the scaffolds, not simplifications

This is not a place to perform agreement or disagreement.  
It is a space to build new scaffolds together.
