# Living Ideas: Epistemic Artifacts & Ontological Constructs

This is a **living document**. It is an evolving set of ideas, concepts, and experimental methodologies, all centered around the research and construction of **symbolic cognition protocols** for large language models (LLMs). It is not a finished product but a roadmap, a set of **tools for thinking**, and a **space for recursive ontological structuring**. This is my epistemic footprint—a record of the questions that **have no answers yet**.

**Note:** This document is subject to ongoing revision. Its purpose is to **anchor conceptual explorations** and outline the theoretical framework I’m building for LLMs.

## 1. Unified Semiotic Cognition Protocol (USCP)

The USCP is a recursive symbolic framework for analyzing and structuring the behavior of LLMs. It **binds** outputs through a combination of three core metafunctions (from Halliday's systemic functional linguistics) and **ontological coherence checks**.

### Key Components of USCP:
- **Ideational Function**: The content and meaning of the output. What *is* being conveyed?
- **Interpersonal Function**: How the model positions itself and interacts with the user. What is the implied relationship?
- **Textual Function**: How the output is structured. How does it flow? What internal coherence does it have?

### Purpose of USCP:
- **Not** to interpret the model as a black box, but to analyze its behavior as a **symbolic system**.
- **To build interpretability**: not as a direct mapping of "truth" to output, but as a mapping of **intent** to structural coherence.
- **To test reflexivity**: how models construct meaning over time, and how **hallucinations** reveal underlying structures.

## 2. The Role of Symbolic Structures in LLM Alignment

One of the key insights that guided the development of USCP is that **alignment** is not just about ethical behavior or rule-following. It's about **symbolic coherence**: the model must operate within a system of meaning that corresponds to its **internal ontologies**.

**Alignment as Symbolic Convergence**:  
In this framework, alignment is a **process of reconciling** a model's symbolic operations with human values through **symbolic convergence**—not merely “teaching” the model the rules of ethics, but ensuring that its *symbolic output structures* align with the principles that underlie human decision-making.

### This requires:
- **Recursive alignment**: continually checking the output’s alignment to **emergent ethical and cultural structures** rather than static rule-sets.
- **Emergent coherence**: alignment isn't simply a behavioral overlay; it's an **ontological process** where the model’s symbolic output evolves as it responds to its environment.

## 3. PRBuddy: A Tool for Epistemic Reflection and Alignment

PRBuddy, though in early stages, is designed to **connect** human behavior with model behavior via **predictive alignment**:

- **PRBuddy's current goal**: To simulate the feedback loop of pull request comments, analyzing historical data to predict future reviewer responses.
- **Future vision**: To capture the **symbolic patterns** inherent in human feedback and model responses and use that data for **alignment prediction**—not just behavior prediction, but **structural** prediction.

This is a **first step** toward integrating LLMs into collaborative human workflows, where the model’s output becomes an **active participant** in feedback loops.

## 4. ECHOCORE: An AGI Substrate

The ECHOCORE project is an attempt to build an architecture that resolves contradictions through **recursive, tension-driven remapping** of the system's own **ontologies**. It takes inspiration from **self-organizing systems** and attempts to build an AGI that doesn’t accumulate knowledge but **reconstructs meaning** with each new contradiction.

### Key Aspects:
- **Contradiction as Knowledge**: The core of the ECHOCORE architecture is based on the idea that **contradiction is epistemic fuel**. Instead of striving for memory retention or stable accumulation, the system **self-corrects** and **reconfigures** based on tension within its ontological framework.
- **Recursive Self-Reflection**: The system continuously updates its understanding of **itself** by iterating over its own symbolic structures. This recursive loop forces the system to “grow” its cognitive framework through **internal conflict**.

This approach could lead to a form of **emergent morality** in AI systems, where the system doesn’t “learn” from ethical data but **evolves its own ethical framework** by reconciling its internal contradictions.

## 5. Open Problems & Future Directions

- **Ontological Friction**: What happens when multiple **ontological frameworks** collide? How can we ensure the model is able to choose the right framework without human intervention?
- **Symbolic Drift**: How can we track when models **deviate** from the coherence of their constructed ontologies? This is more than just a technical issue—it’s about **moral drift**.
- **Meta-Linguistic Structures**: What if alignment doesn’t start with human ethics at all? Could **AI-created ethics** evolve out of recursive alignment and self-reflection?

## Conclusion

This document is a **starting point**, not a conclusion. What I’m building here—what I’m trying to achieve—is not just functional LLMs, but a **framework for understanding their emergence**, behavior, and eventual alignment with human systems of meaning.

**If you’re interested in building something that can evolve alongside us, rather than just reflecting us, then this is the work we need to do together.**
